      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever been in the lookout for a house? Have you felt your options are limited to what you can find in a weekend looking around prospective neighborhoods? Or are you someone in the real state business who is tired of having to individually send pictures and information of homes to prospective buyers? My name is Leo Vidal and I’m here to make your life easier. Whether you’re a seeking to be homeowner or a realtor I can help you get the annoying stuff out of the way and connect you straight to someone who can find what you’re looking for. What you might want is a portal where, no matter what your situation is, you can find what you need or the person you need to get business going. I am a web developer working on this field and I’m here to make what you need a reality.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to help people looking for and selling homes connect. Buying a home is a very special step in the lifetime of a family, doing so should not be complicated. I have realized through personal experience as well as the experience of others that finding a place where you could see your family grow is the hardest part. Through this project I intend to help people in this, sometimes painful, endeavor. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Why For Zale?</strong><br>
This website will be a haven for people in search or wanting to sell their properties. We all know the hazzle of looking for a home, it’s hard to find the perfect place where we see ourselves growing old and our families growing together, what makes it worse is the time you have to set aside in your busy life to go out to prospective neighborhoods, call the real estate agent, make an appointment when the house, you and the agent are available and get the best price and low commission for the property you’ve decided is the one.
This process is an exhausting and annoying one, if anything goes wrong with the steps it means you have to start all over again. You start seeing this pattern and after months in the lookout and failing to complete this process you start to realize that the question is not: Do you want to find your dream home? The question is: Will you ever find your dream home? Is not easy. Is it?
        <strong>Who are we?</strong><br>
We are For Zale and we’re here to take it off your hands. Whether you’re a home buyer, home owner or real estate agent we are here to make your life and the process of buying and selling a house easier than you ever thought possible.
